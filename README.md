# Professional Practices In Pakistan Tech Industry

In light of Professional Practices in Information Technology, we aim to conduct our research and perform real-time cases by selecting a company that we will talk about shortly. We have taken a particular area from our course that we are going to target and focus on. Based on that particular area, we will develop a questionnaire to ask them about the practices they currently follow in their organization and see how much they entail Professional Practices in their company’s administrative, business, and marketing policies.

This project will not only help us get in touch with the senior administrative staff of the company and get a chance to interview them, but we will also learn the practical implementation and importance of our theoretical concepts that are implemented in real-time with the actual concrete example from a top multinational organization that is often known for its professionalism. The aim of this study is also to highlight some of the areas in which this particular organization is not following the professional practices that it should follow, and we will suggest some recommendations that can broaden their discussion and include them in policies.

## Target Company:

The organization that we have intended to interview for their administration is “Afiniti”. Afiniti is an award-winning business change consultancy that delivers change with a people focus. They’re all about making change stick, and their three core values of ‘People at the Heart, Put the Client First, and Act with Integrity‘ reflect their passion and commitment to shaping and delivering sustainable change with their clients.

Afiniti is a leading provider of customer experience (CX) and artificial intelligence (AI). Their CX AI solutions deliver measurably better business outcomes for some of the largest enterprises in the world. Their technology is used globally in the healthcare, telecommunications, hospitality, insurance, and banking industries and across multiple customer experience channels.

Founded in 2006, the company is headquartered in Hamilton, Bermuda.

## Target/Contact Person:

The contact person that we have aimed to target is “Shamayel Atiq” from the company. He is currently the “Assistant Manager Talent Acquisition” in the company for about over two years.

Being a highly experienced HR representative within the company, he handles a significant portion of professional matters concerning employees, new recruits, managers, and businesses. Consequently, he emerged as the most appropriate individual for us to engage in an interview, delving into various aspects such as HR, administrative policies, contracts, legal responsibilities, anti-discrimination measures, company registration, and employee advancement. We utilized a questionnaire to gather firsthand examples for our research on Professional Practices in Information Technology.
